 A control API for a novel modular synthetic muscle, Myo\+Syn is a portmanteau of Synthetic (as in man-\/made) and Myosin (a protein fundamental to muscle function, which is also how you pronounce Myo\+Syn). This C++ API allows us to actuate this muscle with closed-\/loop control using our custom Quick\+DAQ software.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
Myo\+Syn requires the following libraries\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Quick\+DAQ\+: A custom data acquisition library able to utilize National Instruments DAQ hardware
\item Mini\+PID\+: A PID control and tuning library
\item c\+Linked\+List\+: A small C library that implements a simple double linked list
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
In addition to the API, the dependencies are also included in this repo as git submodules.
